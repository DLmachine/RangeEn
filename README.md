# RangeEn
This package implements the RangeEn-A and RangeEn-B measures and also, generates all figure of the paper: A. Omidvarnia, M. Mesbah, M. Pedersen, G. Jackson, "Range entropy: a bridge between signal complexity and self-similarity", arXiv 2018.

EEG datasets used in this package are publicaly available at: http://epileptologie-bonn.de/cms/front_content.php?idcat=193&lang=3&changelang=3, reference: Andrzejak RG, Lehnertz K, Rieke C, Mormann F, David P, Elger CE (2001) Indications of nonlinear deterministic and finite dimensional structures in time series of brain electrical activity: Dependence on recording region and brain state, Phys. Rev. E, 64, 061907

Implementation of the RangeEn functions as well as SampEn and ApEn in this package is based on the 'sampen' function of 'nolds' library: https://github.com/CSchoel/nolds, https://pypi.org/project/nolds/
